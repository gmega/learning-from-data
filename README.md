# Learning From Data - Solutions to Coursework
This repository contains the source code to my solutions to the homework assignments handed out as part of Yaser Abu-Mostafa's [Learning From Data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html) MOOC. 

Apart from the source code, I have also published precompiled (HTML) versions of all [R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/). You can find a link to each of these precompiled versions below:

1. [Homework 1](http://rpubs.com/giuliano_mega/373541) ([questions](https://work.caltech.edu/homework/hw1.pdf))
2. [Homework 2](http://rpubs.com/giuliano_mega/375243) ([questions](https://work.caltech.edu/homework/hw2.pdf))

4. [Homework 4](http://rpubs.com/giuliano_mega/378392) ([questions](https://work.caltech.edu/homework/hw4.pdf))

If you spot a mistake, I'll be happy to hear about it! Thanks!
